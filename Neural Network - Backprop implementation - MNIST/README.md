# Neural network implementation

This implementation uses the ```copy``` module for the ```deepcopy``` function. To run the code, change the relevant parameters in the ```config``` dictionary inside ```neuralnet_starter.py``` and run it. The script will plot the cost functions and the training accuracies.

Gradient checking is present in th file ```gradient_check.py```, which checks one output bias gradient, one hidden unit bias gradient, and two output and hidden weight gradients using an $\epsilon$ value of 0.01
